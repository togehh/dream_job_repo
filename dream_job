The second job I found is also in the tech environment.

Main task is to prepare and provide reportings reflecting various KPIs. The desired deliverables are in line with the discussion, 
the role is as expected for the data analyst examples.
Desired skills also contain expected elements, such as: SQL, Pyhton, data visualization and business understanding. 
Further, ability to do versioning with Git is a plus.
